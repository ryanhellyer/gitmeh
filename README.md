# gitmeh ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

**AI-powered git commits for the terminally lazy.**

**gitmeh** is a high-speed shortcut for your personal garbage repositories. It is designed specifically for those projects where quality is a myth and your only real goal is closing the laptop before you have to think about your life choices.

> **⚠️ WARNING:** Using this on a professional team project is a "Get Fired" speedrun tactic. This tool is reckless, indifferent, and definitely not "enterprise-ready." It’s barely "human-ready."

### Why use this?

Because writing thoughtful commit messages for your 14th abandoned side project is a waste of precious nap time. Let a robot lie about your progress instead.

* **Nuclear Staging:** It runs `git add --all` like a maniac. It stages your unfinished thoughts, your API keys, and that 2GB `video.mp4` you accidentally downloaded to your root folder.
* **AI Guesswork:** It begs Google’s Gemini to hallucinate a description of your code because you’ve already checked out mentally.
* **Automatic Pushing:** Shovels your mess directly to the cloud so you can pretend it’s "done."
* **Built-in Judgment:** Features 40+ randomized status messages that openly mock your lack of professional standards and basic work ethic.

### Quick Start

1. **Beg Google for an API Key** at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2. **Litter your shell config** (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`) with more environment variables:
`export GEMINI_API_KEY='your_key_here'`
3. **Force-install the thing** so you can run it without typing those two extra characters for the extension:
```bash
mv gitmeh.sh gitmeh
chmod +x gitmeh
sudo mv gitmeh /usr/local/bin/

```

### Requirements

* `git`: If you don't have this, why are you even here?
* `jq`: To parse the robot's existential dread.
* `curl`: To scream into the void (Google's servers).
